### A Classroom Budget Experiment

This is the repo for a classroom experiment that we running in our Humboldt Management Accounting Course. The design of the experiment is heavily inspired by the baseline case of [Evans, Hannan, Krishnan and Moser (TAR, 2001)](https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2001.76.4.537). To spice it up a little we added a treatment where firm headquarters first offer a random budget to the manager (the experimental subject). The manager can then either agree with it or request a different budget.

The results are presented in an [interactive shiny app](https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/budget_exp/). Code and data can be found in this repo. Enjoy!

Hit me up for the otree code if you are interested to run the experiment in your class.
