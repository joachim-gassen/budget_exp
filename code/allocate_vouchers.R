Classroom experiment: the winners have been selected

Dear all:

Those of you who participated in last week's classroom experiment: We have 
drawn the lucky winners. If your public 4 digit experimental ID is included 
in one of the URLs below, you can claim your 10 â‚¬ Amazon voucher.

The winning IDs/URLs are: 

%s
To claim your woucher click on the respective link. It will lead you to a 
password zipped PDF containing the information on how to redeem your 
voucher. The password is your case-sensitive private experimental ID.
This is the 16 digit string following your public experimental ID. You did
write this one down, right? Please claim your voucher soon as I might be
reusing unclaimed vouchers in the next term.

In any case, winner or not, you can still take a look at the experimental
findings at: https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/budget_exp/

Thanks for participating and enjoy your weekends everybody!

Joachim Gassen
